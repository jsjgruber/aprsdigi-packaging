revised 8/6/2012

aprsdigi:
  - try to get added to https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/AmateurRadio
  - Figure out how to get the most current packaged added to Debian, Ubuntu, etc. distros.
  - stuff based on my understanding of fix14439.html and WB4APR's future
    digi wish list (1 Dec 2004; revised 6 May 2005):
    - [wishlist 1] Add "--subst_first" to replace the first flooding
      callsign with mycall.
    - [wishlist 2] Done: multiple "--trace" has been there for a long time.
    - [wishlist 3] Add "--max_hops N" to restrict flooding calls to a maximum
      number of hopes (subtract N-n from WIDEn-N).
    - [wishlist 4] Done: "--kill_dupes" kills all dupes not just those with
      flood/trace aliases.
    - [wishlist 5] Ooops, there is no item 5:-)
    - [wishlist 6] (bi-directional) routing among several transmitters 
      is supported by having multiple "--interface" but rig control to switch
      frequencies is not.  IMHO a busy digi does better to be monitoring each
      radio fulltime rather than going off-frequency. [6d] (routing all traffic
      to an alternate channel) is handled by "--dupe".
    - [fix14439] add "--subst_last" to substitute my call when I am the last
      digi in the WIDEn-N path (e.g. N counts down to zero or exceeds
      "--max_hops").
  - add rate-limiting for lids.  For example, a fixed station transmitting
    it's position every 30 seconds would have all transmissions ignored
    for say 15 minutes at which point the next beacon would be digipeated.
    If the station is moving (info is changing) then don't rate-limit since
    there's useful new information being transmitted.
  - add stats collection ala MHEARD
  - add query responder for MHEARD, etc.
  - add remote sysop via RF ala the way X1J4 does it with one time passwords
    or something.
  - document how to use aprsd UDP port support or whether it makes sense
    to do so vs. just running aprsd in parallel.
  - suppress loops/dupes per-interface???  Currently done globally.
  - make log file list rx/tx port and timestamp?
  - add "tcp:" interface types (both initiator/client and responder/server).
    netcat ./nc -v -u -p 14439 -l | ./nc -v -l -p 14439 localhost 
  - make aprs-is compatible (see aprsd/doc/q.html) or just use aprsd?
  - add file: and/or tty: intf type to support non-KISS-capable TNCs 
    and broken KISS implentations like TH-D7A (this is getting gross).
  - support more than 8 digipeaters in cooked mode?
  - digipeat other than UI frames (digi_ned && requested for opentrac pid 99)
  - Combine unproto() and parsecalls().
  - Figure out why I can't just use standard full_sockaddr instead of
    struct ax_calls.
  - assure 100% alignment with APRS Protocol Spec 1.0
  - If and when there's an official updated protocol spec align to that too.
  - add a real config file instead of hokey command line switches.
  - add IPv6 multicast, IPv4 SSM?
  - Implement HOME: (or did this idea die out?)
  - Implement compressed and/or decompressed GPS strings and posits.
  - Make a new distro rpm and tarball.

mic_e.c: [deprecated - use aprsd]
  - looked at Dale's changes but they *broke* parsing of D7, mic_e pkts???
  - Add PIC-E support: /P>mon
  - Is this necessary anymore given aprsd?
