aprsdigi:
  - set up sf.net:
    - CVS import (done)
    - aprsdigi-users && aprsdigi-devel mailing lists
    - release files/tarball
    - aprsdigi.sf.net web page
  - document how to use aprsd UDP port support or whether it makes sense
    to do so vs. just running aprsd in parallel.
  - make aprs-is compatible (see aprsd/doc/q.html) or just use aprsd?
  - suppress loops/dupes per-interface???  Currently globally.
  - make log file list rx/tx port and timestamp?
  - add "tcp:" interface types (both initiator/client and responder/server).
    netcat ./nc -v -u -p 14439 -l | ./nc -v -l -p 14439 localhost 
  - add file: and/or tty: intf type to support non-KISS-capable TNCs 
    and broken KISS implentations like TH-D7A (this is getting gross).
  - support more than 8 digipeaters in cooked mode?
  - digipeat other than UI frames (digi_ned && requested for opentrac pid 99)
  - Combine unproto() and parsecalls().
  - Figure out why I can't just use standard full_sockaddr instead of
    struct ax_calls.
  - add maxhops for TRACEn-n. (I don't remember what this means!)
  - assure 100% alignment with APRS Protocol Spec 1.0
  - add a real config file instead of hokey command line switches.
  - add IPv6 multicast, IPv4 SSM?
  - Implement HOME: (or did this idea die out?)
  - Implement compressed and/or decompressed GPS strings and posits.
  - Look at my notes from DCC proceedings APRS papers.

mic_e.c:
  - looked at Dale's changes but they *broke* parsing of D7, mic_e pkts???
  - Add PIC-E support: /P>mon
  - Is this necessary anymore given aprsd?

General:
  - Make a new distro rpm and tarball.
