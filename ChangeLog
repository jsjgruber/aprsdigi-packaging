* Changes in aprsdigi-2.6.0, August 2009:
  - added aprsdigi.init script to help automate installation

* Changes in aprsdigi-2.4.4, April 2003:


* Changes in aprsdigi-2.4.3, April 2003:
  - Add support for IP/UDP interface, including IPv4 and IPv6 unicast and
    IPv4 any-source multicast (until I learn how to do SSM and v6 multicast).
  - Add Unix fifo interface and two test programs, fiforead and fifowrite.
    Mostly useful for debugging.
  - "-p port:call...." for ax25 ports is deprecated.  Use "-p ax25:port:..."
  - Add interfaces options to toggle TX-enable, RX-enable and don't retransmit
    on received interface (e.g. for pt-to-pt and IP interface).
  - Add budlist (permit/deny access lists).
  - parse_cooked_ax25() and gen_cooked_ax25() added to libax25ext.  Supports
    parsing TNC2 and AEA formats.  Generates TNC2 format.
  - Corrected destination SSID routing to always work, not just for mic-E
    packets (per APRS Spec 1.02 Ch. 3 p. 12)
  - Added 3rd-party tunneling/de-tunneling (-3) per APRS Spec 1.02 Ch 17.
    I don't understand it, but it's there now.  I use transparent 
    tunneling (-0)!
  - Really fix the fencepost error that I claimed I fixed in 2.4.2!
	
* Changes in aprsdigi-2.4.2, June 2002:
  - Fix fencepost error in expansion of TRACEn-n that was causing a seg fault.

* Changes in aprsdigi-2.4.1, December 2001:
  - Fix loop killing (-L) to actually drop looping packets and not other
    random packets!

* Changes in aprsdigi-2.4.0, November 2001:
  - Apply patches from Hamish Moffatt <hamish@rising.com.au> to update to
    the latest libax25.  
  - Change keep default to 28 seconds to match the documented typical
    value per p.11 of the APRS Protocol Spec 1.0. 
  - Don't digipeat packets that my station originated and then got repeated
    back to me (e.g. beacon -d "APRS via WIDE WIDE" should not be digi'd).
    (Thanks for noticing this one Arte.)
  - Make other cosmetic changes to eliminate need to patch libax25.
  - Rename a couple of functions.
  - Built and tested under a 2.4 kernel.  Renumber the version to reflect
    the kernel version it runs with.

* Changes in aprsdigi-2.0, March 1999:
  General aprsmon and aprsdigi changes:
  - Fix incorrect order of Mic-E longitude calculation which resulted in, 
    among other errors, a zero longitude displaying as 19060.00W.
  - Corrections and changes to Mic-E -> "MIM" translations as requested
    by Bob Bruninga, including support for Kenwood TH-D7.
  - Fix T#MIC telemetry
  - Strip TheNet X1J4 BTEXT prefix, making an X1J4 node's beacon look
    like a regular APRS beacon.
  - Rename the package from aprsmon to aprsdigi-2.0 since the dominant
    useful code in the package is now the digi.  arpsmon should probably
    be replaced by WA4DSY's aprsd.
  - Changes for Linux kernel 2.2 (AF_PACKET instead of AF_INET).
  - Changes for GNU libc 2 (glibc, a/k/a libc6).
  - Use autoconf and automake.

  aprsdigi-specific changes:
  - Bring aprsdigi WIDE flooding implementation into alignment with current
    WIDEn-n definition.
  - Add real control of how to interconnect (gate) multiple interfaces:
    - Tie each of my callsigns/aliases to an interface:
      replace -rxa switches with -p port1:alias,alias... -p port2:alias...
    - routing between interfaces now based on next-hop callsign.
    - one-to-many relationship supported by giving the same alias to multiple
      interfaces.  Each interface with the matching next-hop alias will
      transmit, with per-interface customizations (e.g. MYCALL substitution
      is based on the callsign of the interface).
  - Make tag/idinterval, reformatting of Mic-E and X1J4, etc. selectable
    per-interface (rather than global) options.
  - Implement TRACE: Note that TRACEn-n vs. plain TRACE do
    different things: TRACEn-n *inserts* calls into the digipath while
    decrementing ssid. e.g.:
	RELAY*,TRACE3-3
	RELAY,N2YGK-7*,TRACE3-2
	RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII*,TRACE3-1
	RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII,N2MH-15*,TRACE3
	RELAY,N2YGK-7,WB2ZII,N2MH-15,WA2YSM-14*
    "Plain Old" TRACE just does a one-for-one mycall substitution.
  - Kill looping packets (-L option):
	RELAY*,WIDE,WIDE,WIDE
	RELAY,N2YGK-7*,WIDE,WIDE
	RELAY,N2YGK-7,WIDE*,WIDE
			     ^---- normally n2ygk-7 would respond to this,
	but, by finding one of mycall earlier in the path, I know to ignore it.
