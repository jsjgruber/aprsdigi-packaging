Where to find the latest releases:

The official places where I put new versions are:

   http://www.cloud9.net/~alan/ham/aprs/
   ftp://ftp.tapr.org/aprssig/linux/

Others may mirror this stuff elsewhere, but I only promise that the
latest will be at the above two sites.

If you are not a member of Tucson Amateur Packet Radio (TAPR), consider
joining!  See www.tapr.org

See the aprsdigi.8 and aprsmon.1 man pages.  Aprsdigi is an intelligent
digipeater (see the APRS Protocol Reference, ISBN 0-9644707-6-4, at
http://www.tapr.org).

Aprsmon enables a rudimentary TNC monitor as expected by Steve Dimse's
javAPRS applet.  If you want to build the aprsmon without saving up
stale packets in a shared memory segment, give the --disable-shm
option to configure.  However, you should probably use aprsd instead,
since it is a more complete implementation.  See the AX25-HOWTO
or http://sourceforge.net/projects/aprsd/.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
