Announcing N2YGK's Linux aprsdigi-3.5.1.				September 2012

Release 3.5.1 of N2YGK's advanced APRS digipeater is now available for
free under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL) at
http://aprsdigi.sourceforge.net.

This release has no new features in the base code from aprsdigi-2.4.5 as the APRS
protocol and aprsdigi code have been stable and operating in production on
a number of digipeaters for many years. However, a number of packaging and documentation
updates have happened:

Added in 3.5.1:

- As usual, the version number has been updated to match the Linux kernel release that 
  Aprsdigi has been built and tested against. (The code actually hasn't had to change since
  kernel 2.4 when ax25 stuff stopped changing.)
- Minor source code changes for netax25 include files no longer required.
- Updated the RPM SPEC file to build aprsdigi for use on Fedora Core 17 or similar systems.
  - Replaced SysV init script (/etc/init.d/aprsdigi) with systemd unit files.
- Added some example configuration files and description of how I build APRS digipeaters
  in ./examples
- Documentation here of 2.4.5 changes that weren't documented at the time (shame on me):

Added in 2.4.5:
- Updated the man page for the "--long" command line options.
- Fixes SIGUSR1 only working once (bug 916083 reported by KE2LJ)
- Updates to the TODO list

Added in 2.4.4:

- Aprsdigi is now a sourceforge.net project.  Please visit aprsdigi.sf.net
  and sign up to be a developer or join the users or developers mailing lists.
- Short (-s) command line options replaced with long ones (--long).  Short
  options are now deprecated and may disappear in a future release.
- Ability to specify a list of ports that get sent a verbatim duplicate copy
  of all packets received on a given port.  Useful for "reflecting" what's
  heard on an RF port to a local LAN for instance.  This is different from
  APRS-IS (e.g. aprsd) since the data is sent with UDP (multicast or unicast).
  Use with caution (or not at all) on RF ports.

Added in 2.4.3:
- UDP/IP (v4 and v6) unicast and multicast (ASM) support.  Useful for 
  connecting aprsdigi's over the Internet, WLANs, etc.
  (Note: this is *not* TCP support as used by APRS-IS, aprsd, etc.)
  Both transparent and "3rd party" tunneling are supported.
- Budlist to permit/deny digipeating of traffic for individuals or groups of
  AX.25 and IP sources.  IP budlists are helpful when using IP multicast!
- Interfaces may be set to transmit- or receive-only.
- Interfaces may be set to disable retransmission of received packets on
  the same interface (one-armed routing).  
- Unix FIFO supported as an interface type.  Mostly useful for debugging.
- Bug fixed that caused aprsdigi to crash upon TRACEn-n callsign insertion
  when the digipeater list was full.

Along with these features:
- Digipeater callsign substitution (e.g. RELAY replaced w/N0CLU-12).
- WIDE, WIDEn-n, TRACE, and TRACEn-n.
- As many radio interfaces as you can plug into your Linux machine
  with flexible gatewaying between them.
- Special handling for Mic-Encoder, Kenwood TH-D7, and TheNet X1J4, including
  SSID-based digipeating.
- Suppression of duplicate and looping packets.
- Works with Linux 2.4 kernel AX.25 network stack.  This means any AX.25
  interface supported by the kernel will work, not just a TNC2 clone.
  Examples include all the BAYCOM interfaces (BAYPAC, PICPAR, PICSER, etc.),
  soundcards, 8530 SCC cards, any serial port KISS TNC, etc.
