N2YGK's aprsdigi 2.4.3 installation instructions
----------------------------------------------

Alan Crosswell, n2ygk@weca.org

PREREQUISITES:
-------------

1. You must have a Linux 2.4.x kernel with AX.25 and "Packet socket" configured
   (CONFIG_AX25 and CONFIG_PACKET) along with the applicable low-level
   AX.25 drivers (CONFIG_MKISS, CONFIG_BAYCOM*, CONFIG_SOUNDMODEM*, etc.)
   This release of my software has been tested with Linux 2.4 and GNU libc
   2 (glibc) on a Red Hat 8.0 distribution.  See the AX25-HOWTO for 
   instructions:  http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/AX25-HOWTO.html

2. You need libax25.a and the corresponding include files.  These are
   part of the libax25-0.0.7 (or later) package.  You also will need
   ax25-tools and you might as well get ax25-apps too.  The AX25-HOWTO
   tells how to get and install these as well.

INSTALLING FROM SOURCES:
-----------------------

First make sure you have libax25 installed.

Then untar and build aprsdigi:

  gunzip -c aprsdigi-2.4.3.tar.gz | tar xfz -
  cd aprsdigi-2.4.3
  ./configure
  make
  make install

CONFIGURING
-----------
